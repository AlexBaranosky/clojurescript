* Title
** Clojure...
*** Rocks
** Javascript...
*** Reaches
** Announcing Clojure on Javascript
*** ClojureScript
* Problem statement
** Javascript is the only programmable technology in key target environments
*** i.e. the browser
*** nothing will change that for years to come
** and has the greatest reach in other key environments
*** i.e. mobile
** Javascript (the language) is not very robust
*** Fewer good parts than bad parts
*** Much convention and discipline required to avoid headaches
*** Conventions differ between shops, libs
** Ever increasing pressure to create richer applications in these environments
*** requiring more, and larger, libraries
**** ordinary minification doesn't scale up
*** increasing requirements complexity
**** can't add language or environment complexity on top
* Rationale
** Clojure is simpler, more powerful and more robust than JS
** JS VMs getting faster and more sophisticated
** Putting Clojure on JS empowers developers
* Strategy
** Compile (a substantial subset of) Clojure to Javascript source
** Leverage best-of-breed JS approaches
** Look beyond the browser
** Non-objectives
*** Complete Clojure
*** Portable large applications
*** Browser REPL demos etc
** Target is production applications
* Tactics
** Clojure in Clojure
*** Written in Clojure and itself
** Clojure on Closure
*** Google's JS toolkit
* Demo
** REPL
** Compilation
** Web app
** CLI app?
* Where we are at
** What's there?
*** Compiler
*** REPL
*** All the primitives
*** Arity overloading
*** Macros
*** Seqs, maps, vectors, sets
**** and supporting library
**** callable maps, vectors, sets
*** Symbols and keywords
*** deftypes and protocols
*** all the core abstractions as protocols
*** destructuring
*** 2500 lines of core libs!
*** clojure.string and .set
*** reader?
** What's not (yet)?
*** Full collection persistence
*** Multimethods
*** Hierarchy
*** Rich numerics
*** Testing framework
*** Misc core lib
** What won't be?
*** things related to threads
*** eval and runtime compilation
*** structs, proxy, Java type stuff
*** Runtime reification of:
**** Vars
**** Namespaces
**** Protocols
** On the fence
*** optimizations
**** chunks, transients
*** agents (on webworkers?)
*** unchecked
** What's different
*** no runtime Vars
** It's alpha
* Where we are going
** This is Clojure's client story
** This is Clojure's mobile story
** This is Clojure's CLI scripting story
